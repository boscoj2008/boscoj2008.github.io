# Regression: Building a predictive model

Linear regression or the ordinary least sqaures method, is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to predict a continuos valued output. Everytime we fit a multiple linear regression model to our data, we compute a set of weights or coefficients $\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2, \beta_3...\beta_n$ where $\beta_0$ is the intercept or the constant plus a bias term also called the error term $\epsilon$.

Today, I will be analysing two datasets i.e
